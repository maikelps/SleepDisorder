# Sleep Issue Predictor

The Sleep Issue Predictor app leverages machine learning models to predict the probability of a user having a sleep issue based on their personal data, including age, sleep duration, heart rate, daily steps, gender, weight, height, and whether they work in a technical field. If a user is found likely to have a sleep issue, the app also identifies the type of issue, either "Sleep Apnea" or "Insomnia".

## Features:

* Intuitive sidebar for user input.
* Visual representation of sleep issue probability through an illustrative silhouette of a person.
* Identification of the type of sleep issue.
* Data visualization to aid in user understanding.

## Sidebar:

* Enter your age: Specify your age.
* Enter sleep duration: Input how many hours you usually sleep.
* Enter heart rate: Provide your average heart rate.
